	<p>Hey all, Namaste, thanks for your time. I am  a <strong>full stack web designer</strong>, based out of <em>bengaluru</em>. You can reach out to me for any of your web design works, I write perfect <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">html</abbr> &amp; CSS.</p>
	<p>By the way am the 1<sup>st</sup> in the group. H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
	<p>I am ardent follower of Mahatma Gandhi, and as he says <q cite="">You must be the change you wish to see in the world.</q></p>

	<blockquote cite="http://example.com/facts">
		<p>If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.</p>
		<cite>Charles Bukowski</cite>
